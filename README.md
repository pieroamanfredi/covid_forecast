# covid_forecast
Data sources and forecast techniques applied to COVID / Coronavirus. In particular in order tome 
measure / forecast at a geografical level the impact in terms of peope sick and casualties.

#Special Thanks
Dear Coronavirus (Covid19, SARS-CoV-2,  2019-nCoV or any other fancy name), thanks for all the time I am spending at home and not going anywhere, thanks for 
my concerns about to get toilet tissue and for be damaging my hands skins with so much soaps, thanks
for the continues paranoia to give virus to the lovely elders. I thought for me to give you something back
some of this time in my house I could use it for this repo.
Also serious people and Boris Johnson say you want to kill me. That is not polite.

##ARIMA Forecast
For many countries using European Centro For Disease Prevention and Control Data.
There are different output and graphs including for cast for the next 3 days and graphs.

#Literature Review
##Epidemics studies Summaries. For Forecast/Prediction

1. Dugas, Andrea Freyer et al. “Influenza forecasting with Google Flu Trends.” PloS one vol. 8,2 (2013): e56176. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056176
    **Background**
    We developed a practical influenza forecast model based on real-time, geographically focused, and easy to access data, designed to provide individual medical centers with advanced warning of the expected number of influenza cases, thus allowing for sufficient time to implement interventions. Secondly, we evaluated the effects of incorporating a real-time influenza surveillance system, Google Flu Trends, and meteorological and temporal information on forecast accuracy.
    
    **Methods** 
    Forecast models designed to predict one week in advance were developed from weekly counts of confirmed influenza cases over seven seasons (2004–2011) divided into seven training and out-of-sample verification sets. Forecasting procedures using classical Box-Jenkins, generalized linear models (GLM), and generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GARMA) methods were employed to develop the final model and assess the relative contribution of external variables such as, Google Flu Trends, meteorological data, and temporal information.
    
    **Results**
    A GARMA(3,0) forecast model with Negative Binomial distribution integrating Google Flu Trends information provided the most accurate influenza case predictions. The model, on the average, predicts weekly influenza cases during 7 out-of-sample outbreaks within 7 cases for 83% of estimates. Google Flu Trend data was the only source of external information to provide statistically significant forecast improvements over the base model in four of the seven out-of-sample verification sets. Overall, the p-value of adding this external information to the model is 0.0005. The other exogenous variables did not yield a statistically significant improvement in any of the verification sets.
    
    **Conclusions** 
    Integer-valued autoregression of influenza cases provides a strong base forecast model, which is enhanced by the addition of Google Flu Trends confirming the predictive capabilities of search query based syndromic surveillance. This accessible and flexible forecast model can be used by individual medical centers to provide advanced warning of future influenza cases.

    **Abstract**
    **Background:** Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is endemic to Africa and Asia, but the Asian genotype invaded the Americas in 2013. The fast increase of human infections in the American epidemic emphasized the urgency of developing detailed predictions of case numbers and the potential geographic spread of this disease.
    
    **Methods:** We developed a simple model incorporating cases generated locally and cases imported from other countries, and forecasted transmission hotspots at the level of countries and at finer scales, in terms of ecological features.
    
    **Results:** By late January 2015, >1.2 M CHIKV cases were reported from the Americas, with country-level prevalences between nil and more than 20 %. In the early stages of the epidemic, exponential growth in case numbers was common; later, however, poor and uneven reporting became more common, in a phenomenon we term "surveillance fatigue." Economic activity of countries was not associated with prevalence, but diverse social factors may be linked to surveillance effort and reporting.
    
    **Conclusions:** Our model predictions were initially quite inaccurate, but improved markedly as more data accumulated within the Americas. The data-driven methodology explored in this study provides an opportunity to generate descriptive and predictive information on spread of emerging diseases in the short-term under simple models based on open-access tools and data that can inform early-warning systems and public health intelligence.

   We provide data-driven machine learning methods that are capable of making real-time influenza forecasts that integrate the impacts of climatic factors and geographical proximity to achieve better forecasting performance. The key contributions of our approach are both applying deep learning methods and incorporation of environmental and spatio-temporal factors to improve the performance of the influenza forecasting models. We evaluate the method on Influenza Like Illness (ILI) counts and climatic data, both publicly available data sets.
