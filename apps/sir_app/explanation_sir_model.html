<h2>SIR Model</h2>
<p>Compartmental models are a technique used to simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious disease. The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics.
</p>
<p>The model consists of three compartments: S for the number of susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number of recovered or deceased (or immune) individuals.
</p>
<p>  One of the key features of this models is to identify when the peak is going to happen and how much populations could affect.

 <p>Between S and I, the transition rate is βI, where β is the average number of
     contacts per person per time, multiplied by the probability of disease
     transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject. </p>
 <p>I and R, the transition rate is γ (simply the rate of recovery or mortality,
     that is, number of recovered or dead during one day divided by the total number
     of infected on that same day, supposing "day"
     is the time unit. </p>
